# Real-or-Fake-news ML project
This is my first machine learning project based on the yt training playlist linked above. You can find a Jupyter Notebook where I implemented a ML model based on the algorithm of Logistic Regression to predict, starting from a very large dataset of news labeled by some targets, as the author, the text of the news ecc..., wether a news is fake or real. What's interesting, in the end, is that such a trained model turns out to be very accurate in the prediction.

In order to enjoy it, you just have to open the .ipynb file and give a look to the Jupyter Notebook that will appear alongside.
